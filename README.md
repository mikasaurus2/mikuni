## What is this?

This is a repository of assignments to help people learn to code.
The idea here is to help people learn through guidance and code reviews.

## How do I engage with `mikuni`?

By doing the assignments! Each assignment has an associated README
file with instructions.

My goal for `mikuni` is that it be educational and fun. You're learning
a new skill (or improving it)! There's an awesome feeling that comes
from completing a program and seeing it work, whether it was for fun
or for more practical reasons. I'm hoping you get that feeling from these
assignments.

Having said that, learning to code can be frustrating at times.
There's so much to learn that it can feel like drinking from a firehose.
Luckily, you don't need to know everything to get to a point where you
can make useful programs. You may run into bugs that are difficult
to fix. But just remember, the more difficult the bug is to track down,
the more rewarding the feeling is when you finally fix it. Fixing difficult
bugs is also a great learning experience. So, don't get discouraged.

As you go through these, you need to be willing to learn and
do research. There are a lot of good, online, free resources for coding.
You can find them easily by googling. It's also totally fine to google
how to do things and learn from StackOverflow. If you do this though,
do not simply copy code. It's important to understand what the code is doing.

Other people's implementations will be stored in this repository too.
Looking at how others solved coding challenges is another good way to learn. 
But, I recommend you save those for after you've completed the assignment.

Finally, go at your own pace and focus on one problem at a time.
Don't rush through the assignments just for the sake of completing
them.

## How is this different from Udemy or Codecademy or HackerRank, etc?

Those are all great resources. Some of the assignments here may be similar, but
they are not intended to replace or duplicate the work on those sites.

The benefit of `mikuni` assignments is that they be can crafted to provide practical
coding experience. The hope is that people completing the assignments will
develop the skills required to contribute to the company's code base in some
fashion.

Another benefit is **code reviews**. These assignments will be reviewed via
GitHub. Code reviews are extremely important in production code. They help
catch bugs and ensure code is well designed and meets standards. These assignments
are a great way to get experience with that process.

More importantly, in this case, code reviews allow people to learn good code!
Completing small problems and classes on the sites mentioned above is great for
learning a language, but there isn't a lot of focus on good design or best
practices that are developed through years of experience. Code reviews will
cover these topics.

## How does this whole thing work?

After you get your environment set up, here's the general flow:

1. Read the README.md associated with an assignment
2. Do some (or all) of the assignment
3. Make a pull request on GitHub
4. In the pull request, write out your thoughts and questions!
5. Somebody will do a code review
6. You update your assignment accordingly, and do another pull request (usually steps 2 through 5 will loop a few times)
7. Once your pull request is accepted, you can move on to the next assignment
   *or* add more stuff to your finished assignment based on your interest

## How should I interact with my reviewers?

If you have questions about your specific implementation or want feedback on
your progress on an assignment, do a pull request. I want to keep assignment
related discussion on the pull request, because they will be kept on record via
GitHub. You and other people can revisit the pull requests and use them as a
reference. **You don't have to have finished the assignment before doing a pull
request.**

If you're not sure where to ask something, slack me directly.

If you have any feedback on how things are going, slack me directly.

If your cat or dog did something funny, also slack me directly. I'd probably enjoy that story.

## What kind of feedback should I give?

Here are some examples of the things I'm interested in:

1. Are you enjoying coding? Why?
2. Were any instructions not clear?
3. Was an assignment boring / tedius, or was it fun?
4. You got to part X, and even after googling and doing some research, you weren't sure how to proceed.
5. Did a jump from assignment A to B have a very difficult learning curve?
6. Did you want more practice on a particular subject?

## What do I need to start?

1. Join the `#mikuni` channel
2. Have `git` installed
3. Set up your favorite text editor

> Pro tip: It's customary to argue about which text editor is best, but really,
> we only do it because it is tradition. You can use whatever you like. Vim
> and Emacs are two popular ones and available almost everywhere. All that matters
> is that when you mention something about text editors, follow it up with...
> "(all the cool kids use X)" where X is your text editor.

4. Install any relevant compiler or interpreter based on the assignment
