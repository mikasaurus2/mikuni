## 1.
## Initialize a variable with your name and print it.




## 2.
## Define a function CelsiusToFahrenheit() that takes a number
## in celsius, converts it to fahrenheit, and returns that value.
## Then invoke that function a couple of times with different values
## and print the result.




## 3.
## Create a list of 10 random numbers. (You can generate them, or just
## think them up.) Iterate through the list and print the numbers out.




## 4.
## Using the same list from #3, write some code below that finds
## the largest number in the list, and prints it out.




## 5.
## Create a loop that asks the user to input a number between 1
## and 10. If the user inputs any number other than 7, tell them
## they're wrong and ask again.




## 6.
## Create a Dog class and pupulate (heh, get it?) it with member
## variables and methods. This is pretty open ended. The goal here
## is to understand what properties and behaviors a class represents,
## so just add what you'd expect to see in a Dog class.
##
## a. Point out the class constructor and explain what that does.
## b. What is the *self* keyword in the class methods?
## c. What is the difference between a private and public method?




## 7.
## Create a 2-dimensional list. That is, a list where every
## element in that list is another list! (Instead of just
## a number, or a string.)
## This will come in handy for a future assignment.
##
## a. How do you access elements in a 2-d list?
